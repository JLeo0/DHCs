# Description
- This is a [Modelica](https://modelica.org/) simulation research for district heating and cooling (DHC) system combined with ground-source heat pump system, based on an actual project in Chongqing, China. 
- The research mainly includes the following parts:
	+ Simulate the energy consumption of the DHC system when the cooling or heating equipment are connected in parallel or series on the source side;
	+ Simulate the hydraulic stability, thermal stability and energy consumption of the DHC system when the decouplers are set at different positions in constant primary flow/variable secondary flow system;
	+ Optimize of the DHC system based on the original design and calculate its energy saving rate;
	+ And so on.
