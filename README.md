# Description
- This is a [Modelica](https://modelica.org/) simulation research for district heating and cooling (DHC) system combined with ground-source heat pump system, based on an actual project in Chongqing, China. 
- The research includes the following parts:
	+ Changes in the energy consumption of main part of the DHC system when the cold and hot source equipment are connected in parallel or series on the source side;
	+ Changes in hydraulic stability, thermal stability and energy consumption of the DHC system when the decouplers are set at different positions in constant primary flow/variable secondary flow system;
	+ Optimization of this DHC system based on the original design and calculation its energy saving rate;
	+ And so on.
